A website recreating the game mastermind.

## How to play

At the start of the game, 6 random colors are chosen. This is the random code which the player must try to guess.

After each guess, the player is told:

1. how many colors in their guess were correct, but in the wrong position (white pegs)
2. how many colors in their guess were both correct and in the correct position (black pegs)

If the guess matches the code exactly, the game ends.

At any point the player may see their previous guesses and pegs
